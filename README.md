# Project 6 - *Be Real App Pt. 2*

Submitted by: **Anthony Rufin**

**BeRealApp** is an app that attempts to emulate the functionality of social media platforms such as BeReal. The user is able to create an account and submit photos to show onto a feed that other users can see. The user can now use the camera to take photos and upload them onto the app, along with the ability to logout, maintain a persistent session even after the app closes, and blurs images until the user uploads their own.
